# shiny-softreset-counter
This is a shiny pokemon soft reset counter I created in Visual Basic.

In pokemon, some individuals attempt to try shiny hunting. A method where users play the game and count the amount of pokemon they see until they find a shiny. This application can be used to keep count of the amount of pokemon seen throughout the game by pressing a button on screen each time a new pokemon is encountered.
